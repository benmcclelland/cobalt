\subsection*{Queueing Jobs}
\textit{\textbf{qsub} [flags] \textless executable\textgreater \space [executable\_args]}
\textit{qsub} is the basic command for submitting jobs for execution.  Commonly used flags include:
\begin{list}{}{}
\item \textit{-n \textless size\textgreater}: requested number of nodes
\item \textit{-t \textless time\textgreater}: requested wallclock time in minutes or HH:MM:SS
\item \textit{-A \textless project\_name\textgreater}:  run against specified allocation
\item \textit{-q \textless queue\_name\textgreater}: specify a queue, if none specified routes to "default"
\item \textit{--attrs location=\textless location\textgreater}: run a job on block \textless location\textgreater
\item \textit{--mode}: one of script, c1,c2,c4,c8,c16,c32,c64:
    Corresponds to runjob's --ranks-per-node flag
--proccount \textless num\textgreater : number of MPI processes to start up
\item \textit{--envs key1=val1:key2=val2:...}: pass environment variables into the compute job
\item \textit{--dependencies job1:job2:...}: allow the job to run only if all listed 
    jobs complete with an exit status of 0
\item \textit{--dependencies None}: remove all dependencies on a job
\item \textit{--cwd \textless dir\textgreater}: set the job's cwd to dir
\end{list}

Consult the qsub manpage for a more detailed description of the flags available.

\subsection*{Querying Jobs}
\textit{qstat} allows you to get information on jobs and queues that are active on the system. Pass a jobid into it to get information pertaining to one job.

\begin{list}{}{}
\item \textit{-f}: Get extended information about a job
\item \textit{-l}: Show information in long view rather than a table view
\item \textit{-u \textless username\textgreater}: get information on all jobs for user
\item \textit{-Q}: gets information on queues
\end{list}

\section*{Reservations}
Parts of the machine may be isolated by an administrator placing a reservation on it.  Reservations grant exclusive access to a group of resources for a group of users for a predetermined amount of time.  If a job is able to run within a reservation, Cobalt will start the job immediately.  Termination of a reservation does not automatically terminate any job that was running within a reservation when the reservation ends.  

\subsection*{Querying Reservations}
Reservations information, including the start times of any upcoming reservations can be obtained through the \textbf{showres} command.  Use the \textit{-l} flag for more detailed information on upcoming reservations. 

\subsection*{Submitting To Reservations}
Typically a reservation will have an associated queue of \textit{R.\textless res\_name\textgreater}.  Specifying that queue for a job will submit the job such that it runs in that queue.

\subsection*{Releasing Reservations}
We strongly encourage users to release reservations after the final job for their reservation has started.  This minimizes the amount of time that it takes to resume normal scheduling.  Releasing a reservation is \textit{not fatal} to jobs currently running within a reservation.

\\
\textit{releaseres \textless reservation\_name\textgreater} will release a reservation

\section*{Blocks}

\subsection{Querying Block Status}

The \textit{partlist} command lists all currently schedulable blocks and their current statuses, including if a block is out of service due to hardware issues, is allocated, or is ready to immediately run jobs.  It also shows the current backfill window if the system is currently draining a block for another job.
